🐱 Codelingo

Codelingo is an AI-powered, gamified mobile learning platform designed to help users master programming languages through interactive, bite-sized lessons. Built with **React Native (Expo)**, it leverages the **Google Gemini Pro AI** to dynamically generate coding challenges tailored to the user's current skill level.


🚀 Key Features

AI-Generated Lessons: Unlike static platforms, Codelingo uses the Gemini Pro model to synthesize "Fill in the Blank" and "Code Arrangement" questions on the fly.
Speech-to-Code: Integrated text-to-speech allows users to hear prompt text and logic explanations, improving accessibility and phonetic retention of syntax.
Real-time Gamification: Tracks XP, Streaks, and Level progression using Firebase Firestore.
Multi-Language Pathing: Dedicated curricula for Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and SQL.
Dynamic Feedback: Provides instant hints and explanations generated by AI when a user makes a mistake.


🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native (Expo), TypeScript
AI Engine: Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
Database: Firebase Firestore
Authentication: Firebase Auth
Audio/Voice: Eleven Labs, Expo AV
Icons: Expo Vector Icons (Ionicons)

🧠 The Lesson Engine Flow
Context Injection: The app sends the user's current language and level to the Gemini service.

JSON Synthesis: Gemini returns a structured object containing a code snippet, correct logical order, and an educational explanation.

Interactive UI: Users engage with native components to arrange code blocks or select the correct syntax.

Sync & Level Up: Upon completion, applyLessonCompletion updates Firestore, increments the user's level, and awards XP.
