🐱 Codelingo

**Codelingo** is an AI-powered, gamified mobile learning platform designed to help users master programming languages through interactive, bite-sized lessons. Built with **React Native (Expo)**, it leverages the **Google Gemini Pro AI** to dynamically generate coding challenges tailored to the user's current skill level.



---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **AI-Generated Lessons:** Unlike static platforms, Codelingo uses the Gemini Pro model to synthesize "Fill in the Blank" and "Code Arrangement" questions on the fly.
* **Speech-to-Code:** Integrated text-to-speech allows users to hear prompt text and logic explanations, improving accessibility and phonetic retention of syntax.
* **Real-time Gamification:** Tracks XP, Streaks, and Level progression using Firebase Firestore.
* **Multi-Language Pathing:** Dedicated curricula for Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and SQL.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** Provides instant hints and explanations generated by AI when a user makes a mistake.

🧠 The Lesson Engine Flow
Context Injection: The app sends the user's current language and level to the Gemini service.

JSON Synthesis: Gemini returns a structured object containing a code snippet, correct logical order, and an educational explanation.

Interactive UI: Users engage with native components to arrange code blocks or select the correct syntax.

Sync & Level Up: Upon completion, applyLessonCompletion updates Firestore, increments the user's level, and awards XP.
